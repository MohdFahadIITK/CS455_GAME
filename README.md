Test coverage

![Some random photo](./test-coverage.png)

Kindly check Metrices folder for code quality, coverage and tests comparison before and after this homework.

## Node Packages Used

- **ESLint**: Enforces code quality through linting with custom rules.
- **Jest**: A framework for unit testing.
- **Jest**: Provides test coverage reporting.
- **SonarQube**: Ensures overall code quality and highlights potential issues.

## Running Code Quality Tools

### Linting
To lint the code and enforce coding standards:
```bash
npm run lint
```
### Testing and Test Coverage
To run the unit tests:
```bash
npm test --coverage
```
### Code quality
To analyze the code with SonarQube:
```bash
npm run sonar
```
# Work Done

## Debugging
- Identified and fixed multiple issues during **BUG BASH** and testing.
- Corrected code to resolve the errors found.

## Refactoring
- Refactored the JavaScript code.
- Introduced **ESLint** to improve code maintainability.
- Integrated **SonarQube**, addressing code smells, duplication, and security vulnerabilities.

## Testing
- Developed comprehensive **unit tests** for the entire application.
- Created a functional test for easier manual verification.

## DevOps
- Configured CI pipelines using `.yml` files to enforce quality gates:
  1. **ESLint** for code linting.
  2. **Jest** for unit testing.
  3. **Jest** for code coverage.
  4. **SonarQube** for static code analysis.
- Automated deployment to **GitHub Pages** after passing all tests.
