## Node Packages Used

- **ESLint**: Enforces code quality through linting with custom rules.
- **Jest**: A framework for unit testing.
- **Jest**: Provides test coverage reporting.
- **SonarQube**: Ensures overall code quality and highlights potential issues.

## Running Code Quality Tools

### Linting
To lint the code and enforce coding standards:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```
### Testing and Test Coverage
To run the unit tests:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test --coverage
```
### Code quality
To analyze the code with SonarQube:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run sonar
```
# Work Done

## Debugging
- Identified and fixed multiple issues during **BUG BASH** and testing.
- Corrected code to resolve the errors found.

## Refactoring
- Refactored the JavaScript code.
- Introduced **ESLint** to improve code maintainability.
- Integrated **SonarQube**, addressing code smells, duplication, and security vulnerabilities.

## Testing
- Developed comprehensive **unit tests** for the entire application.
- Created a functional test for easier manual verification.

## DevOps
- Configured CI pipelines using `.yml` files to enforce quality gates:
  1. **ESLint** for code linting.
  2. **Jest** for unit testing.
  3. **Jest** for code coverage.
  4. **SonarQube** for static code analysis.
- Automated deployment to **GitHub Pages** after passing all tests.

# Cricket101 Application Architecture

## 1. Frontend (React)
- **Components**:
  - **App**: This is the main component.
  - **EndingPage**: This Component gives the game over page
  - **GifComponent**: This Component helps in rendering what gif we have to show on scoring what runs.
  - **LandingPage**: This Component Gives us the starting first page of our webpage.
  - **Play**: This component is the most crucial and holds the playing portion of the game.
  - **LeaderBoard**: This Component gives us the top 10 best scores and names on the game globally.
  
- **Interactions**:
  - 

## 2. Backend (Node.js with Express) - Deployed Using Heroku
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /signup` : Endpoint to handle user sign-up Calls the signup function from the auth module
  - `POST /signin` : Endpoint to handle user sign-in Calls the signin function from the auth module
  - `POST /get-current-score` : Endpoint to get the current session score for a player Calls getSessionScore from the score module
  - `POST /save-current-score` : Endpoint to save the current score of a player session Calls saveSessionScore from the score module
  - `GET /get-top-scores` : Endpoint to fetch the top 10 scores Calls getTop10Scores from the score module
  
- **Logic**:
  - 

## 3. Database (Sqlite)
- **Collections**:
  - **Scores**: This collection stores player scores, names, and game history.
  
- **Interactions**:
  - The backend queries the database to get scores for the leaderboard and stores new scores after games finish.

## Data Flow Overview
- **Frontend to Backend**:
  - Start signin -> `POST /signup`

- **Backend to Database**:
  - Store Score -> `POST /leaderboard/score`


## Summary
In short, the React app is the user interface t

# Testing Pyramid

  - The unit tests for services used are written in folder `back`
  - The Component tests for each react components is mentioned in `frontend/src/components/_test_`
  - The server-database integration test is also written in folder `back`
